about: |

  Bitburner-oxide will automatically push modified or created script files to a running Bitburner game server.

  If ran from the same directory as the scripts the --directory flag is not needed.
  All managed files must exist in the top level directory; bitburner-oxide does not manage nested folders.

  Authentication is done by passing in the bearer-token via --token. 
  Alternatively, the bearer-token can be placed in a file named 'token' in the chosen directory.

  Bitburner-oxide does not currently support deleting, or pulling files from the game server.
